                I'm a trans girl working on several projects and teams in my
                free time. You may have met me from the two teams that I'm part

                Having become one of the new owners of ttb! in 2018 along with
                Kira, I've mainly focused on everything technical for the team
                or the Discord server, such as Discord bots or services that
                were used internally. However, I also occasionally helped run
                the YouTube channel by working on score screens, recording
                plays, and otherwise help with organizing videos. Around 2020,
                Kira resigned officially and Taki was invited to take his place.
                <br />
                Nowadays, Taki focuses on the YouTube channel and anything related
                to it, while I focus on managing the Discord server, internal record-keeping,
                and the YouTube channel. At this time, I'm working on reviving the
                channel with several different approaches.
                <br />
                Before I became the owner, I mainly helped with creating score screens
                and recording plays.

                In 2023, I joined the team as a helper, focusing on missions

                team by developing various tools, during early 2024, I became a
                full team member and shortly after that, a QA Tester for the
                hosted missions. On top of this, during late 2024, I became the
                Event Team 2iC (Second-in-Command/Charge). Whenever both of the
                Event Team Leads are busy, I help run the team when it was
                needed. These days, I usually handle QA and event announcements
                while also building missions.
